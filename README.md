Due to impacts of environmental pollution, people have been more cautious on waste disposal. Waste management involves processes of collection, transportation and disposal of wastes. Depending on the different types and nature of wastes, their management differs.

### Types of Wastes:

Wastes are classified into different types based on the physical appearance. Liquid wastes are liquid in nature, solid wastes are solid and organic wastes are organic in nature. Waste management for liquid wastes is different from solid and organic wastes. Wastes are also classified based on the degree of harm like hospital wastes are classified as infectious, highly infectious and general wastes.

### The Process of Waste Management:

Waste management begins from the point of collection. It is necessary to segregate wastes from the point of collection so that the process becomes easier. The transportation of wastes is the next step and it is different for liquid, solid, organic, hazardous and infectious wastes. Disposal of wastes is the final step in waste management whereby incineration, burying, recycling and treatment of wastes is done.

### Importance of Waste Management:

Waste management is aimed at protection of the environment and to enhance the safety of surrounding environment for humans and animals. Hazardous wastes are disposed far from reach of humans and animals to prevent harm. Environmental pollution is a major public health issue that is prevented by proper waste management because fewer wastes end up in the environment. Recycling as a waste management process enables saving of resources and prevention of accumulation of wastes.

## Waste Classifier 

This is an attempt to classify the type of waste to aid its proper disposal using Tensorflow. 

Our flutter app captures an image of trash and uploads it to our Django backend where it is processed using Tensorflow and its type is predicted.
